# DNS Hijacker

DNS Hijacker is a tool to use a man-on-the-side technique to listen for DNS traffic. When it sees DNS traffic to hijack, it attempts to craft a response packet to send to a victim machine faster than a legitimate response can be sent. If the response is received before the legitimate response, the tool can successfully redirect the victim machine to an attacker controlled site instead of the victim's intended location.
